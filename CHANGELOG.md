### Fixes

- Updated installation logic. The extension will now check to see if QHOME is defined and if so, it will assume that the user has already installed the runtime. If there is no QHOME defined, the extension will prompt the user to install. These will use generic uris which we are still figuring out. There are really 3 profiles for users. The first would be a "managed" install, which would install the bits inside VS Code for the user. The second would be where the user wants to install q runtime outside of VS Code and use it in there, and be guided by the extension and the last is the advanced user who already has the q runtime installed.
